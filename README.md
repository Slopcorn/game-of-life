# game-of-life
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Java on a randomly generated 40x40 field. The game can be paused and the field can be regenerated from scratch.

In making this little toy, I probably broke every single core tenet of software engineering. I might eventually come back and rewrite this to not be so scuffed.
